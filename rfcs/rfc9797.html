<title>RFC 9797: Randomized and Changing Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses: Context, Network Impacts, and Use Cases</title>
<meta content="Jerome Henry" name="author">
<meta content="Yiu L. Lee" name="author">
<meta content="
       To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a
 device, its traffic, its location, and its user in IEEE 802 networks,
 client vendors and client OS vendors have started implementing Media Access
 Control (MAC) address randomization. This technology is particularly
 important in Wi-Fi networks (defined in IEEE 802.11) due to the
 over-the-air medium and device mobility. When such randomization
 happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network
 connectivity and user experience.  At the same time, devices may
 continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the purpose of MAC
 address randomization. 
       This document lists various network environments and a range of
        network services that may be affected by such randomization. This
        document then examines settings where the user experience may be
        affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this document examines
        some existing frameworks that maintain user privacy while preserving
        user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.

  NOTE: Changes at the bottom of this file overrides some earlier settings.

  Once the style has stabilized and has been adopted as an official RFC style,
  this can be consolidated so that style settings occur only in one place, but
  for now the contents of this file consists first of the initial CSS work as
  provided to the RFC Formatter (xml2rfc) work, followed by itemized and
  commented changes found necessary during the development of the v3
  formatters.

<h1 id="title">Randomized and Changing Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses: Context, Network Impacts, and Use Cases</h1>
<section id="section-abstract">
      <h2 id="abstract"><a href="#abstract" class="selfRef">Abstract</a></h2>
<p id="section-abstract-1">To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a
 device, its traffic, its location, and its user in IEEE 802 networks,
 client vendors and client OS vendors have started implementing Media Access
 Control (MAC) address randomization. This technology is particularly
 important in Wi-Fi networks (defined in IEEE 802.11) due to the
 over-the-air medium and device mobility. When such randomization
 happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network
 connectivity and user experience.  At the same time, devices may
 continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the purpose of MAC
 address randomization.<a href="#section-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-abstract-2">This document lists various network environments and a range of
        network services that may be affected by such randomization. This
        document then examines settings where the user experience may be
        affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this document examines
        some existing frameworks that maintain user privacy while preserving
        user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.<a href="#section-abstract-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

         track the activity of WLAN devices. It is also sometimes possible for attackers to monitor the WLAN packets behind the Wi-Fi
         Access Point (AP) over the wired Ethernet. Once the association between a device and its user is made, identifying the 
         device and its activity is sufficient to deduce information about what the user is doing, without the user's consent.<a href="#section-1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-3">To reduce the risks of identifying a device only by the MAC address, client OS 
         vendors have started implementing Randomized and Changing MAC addresses (RCM). By randomizing the MAC address,
         it becomes harder to use the MAC address to construct a persistent association between a flow of data packets and a device, 
         assuming no other visible unique identifiers or stable patterns are in use. When individual devices are no longer easily 
         identifiable, it also becomes difficult 
         to associate a series of network packet flows in a prolonged period with a particular individual using one specific device
         if the device randomizes the MAC address governed by the OS privacy policies.<a href="#section-1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-4">However, such address changes may affect the user experience and the efficiency of legitimate
         network operations. For a long time, network designers and implementers relied on the assumption that a given machine,
         in a network implementing IEEE 802 technologies <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>, would be represented by a unique network MAC address that would not
         change over time. When this assumption is broken, network communication may be disrupted.
         For example, sessions established between the end device and the network services may break, and
         packets in transit may suddenly be lost. If multiple clients implement aggressive (e.g., once an hour or shorter) 
         MAC address randomization without coordination with network services, some network services, such as MAC address caching in
         the AP and the upstream Layer 2 switch, may not be able to handle the load, which may result in an unexpected network interruption.<a href="#section-1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-5">At the same time, some network services rely on the end station
         (as defined by <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>) to provide an identifier,
         which can be the MAC address or another value. This document also
         refers to the end station as a "device" or "machine". If the client
         implements MAC address randomization but continues sending the same
         static identifier, then the association between a stable identifier
         and the station continues despite the RCM scheme.  There may be
         environments where such continued association is desirable, but there
         may be others where user privacy has more value than any continuity
         of network service state.<a href="#section-1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-6">It is useful for implementations of client and network devices to enumerate services that may be
         affected by RCM and to evaluate possible frameworks to maintain both the quality of user experience
         and network efficiency while RCM happens and user privacy is strengthened. This document
         presents these assessments and recommendations.<a href="#section-1-6" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

      </h2>
<p id="section-2-1">In IEEE 802 <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span> technologies, the Media Access Control (MAC) layer defines rules to
control how a device accesses the shared medium. In a network where a machine can
communicate with one or more other machines, one such rule is that each machine needs to be
identified as either the target destination of a message or the source of a message (and the target
destination of the answer). Initially intended as a 48-bit (6-octet) value in the first versions of IEEE 802, other standards under the IEEE 802 <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span> umbrella allow this address to take an
extended format of 64 bits (8 octets), which enabled a larger number of MAC addresses to coexist
as IEEE 802 technologies became widely adopted.<a href="#section-2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-2">Regardless of the address length, different networks have different needs, and several bits of
         the first octet are reserved for specific purposes. In particular, the first bit is used to identify
         the destination address as an individual (bit set to 0) or a group address (bit set to 1). The
         second bit, called the Universal/Local (U/L) address bit, indicates whether the address
         has been assigned by a universal or local administrator. Universally administered addresses have this
         bit set to 0. If this bit is set to 1, the entire address is considered to be locally administered
         (see Clause 8.4 of <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>).    Note that universally administered MAC addresses are
   required to be registered with the IEEE, while locally administered MAC addresses
   are not.<a href="#section-2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-3">The intent of this provision is important for the present document. <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>
         recognizes that some devices (e.g., smart thermostats) may never change their attachment network 
         and will not need a globally unique MAC address to prevent address collision against any other 
         device in any other network. The U/L bit can be set to signal to the network that the MAC address is intended
         to be locally unique (not globally unique). <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>
         did not initially define the MAC address allocation schema when the U/L bit is set to 1. It states the address must 
         be unique in a given broadcast domain (i.e., the space where the MAC addresses of devices are visible to one
         another).<a href="#section-2-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4">It is also important to note that the purpose of the universal version of the address was
         to avoid collisions and confusion, as any machine could connect to any network, and each machine needs
         to determine if it is the intended destination of a message or its response. Clause 8.4 of <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span>
         reminds network designers and operators that all potential members of a network need to have a unique
         identifier in that network (if they are going to coexist in the network without confusion on which
         machine is the source or destination of any message). The advantage of an administrated address is
         that a node with such an address can be attached to any Local Area Network (LAN) in the world with an assurance that its
         address is unique in that network.<a href="#section-2-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-5">With the rapid development of wireless technologies and mobile devices, this scenario became
         very common. With a vast majority of networks implementing IEEE 802 radio technologies <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span> at
         the access, the MAC address of a wireless device can appear anywhere on the planet and collisions
         should still be avoided. However, the same evolution brought the distinction between two types of
         devices that <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802" class="cite xref">IEEE_802</a>]</span> generally refers to as "nodes in a network" (see Section 6.2 of <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802E" class="cite xref">IEEE_802E</a>]</span> for definitions of these devices):<a href="#section-2-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

         MAC address to that user. Then, any detection of traffic that can be associated with the

<p id="section-2.1-1">The possible identification or association presents a privacy issue,
         especially with wireless technologies. For most of them (<span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11</a>]</span> in particular), 
the source and destination MAC
addresses are not encrypted even in networks that implement
encryption. This lack of encryption allows each machine to easily detect if it is the
intended target of the message before attempting to decrypt its
content and also helps identify the transmitter in order to use the right
decryption key when multiple unicast keys are in effect.<a href="#section-2.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2.1-2">This identification of the user associated with a node was clearly not the intent of the
         IEEE 802 MAC address. A logical solution to remove this association is to use a locally administered
         address instead and change the address in a fashion that prevents a continuous association between
         one MAC address and some PII. However, other network devices on the
         same LAN implementing a MAC layer also expect each device to be associated with a MAC address that would
         persist over time. When a device changes
         its MAC address, other devices on the same LAN may fail to recognize that the same machine is attempting
         to communicate with them. This type of MAC address is referred to as 'persistent' MAC address
         in this document. This
         assumption sometimes adds to the PII confusion, for example, in the case of Authentication, Authorization,
         and Accounting (AAA) services <span>[<a href="#RFC3539" class="cite xref">RFC3539</a>]</span> authenticating
         the user of a machine and associating the authenticated user to the device MAC address. Other services
         solely focus on the machine (e.g., DHCPv4 <span>[<a href="#RFC2131" class="cite xref">RFC2131</a>]</span>) but still expect each device to use a 
         persistent MAC address, for example, to reassign the same IP address to a returning device.

            access points or controllers): These devices participate in IEEE
            802 LAN operations. As such, they need to identify each machine as
            a source or destination to successfully continue exchanging
            frames.  As a device changes its network attachment (roams) from

</li>
          <li id="section-3.1-2.2"> Other network devices operating at the MAC layer: Many
            wireless network access devices (e.g., access points <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11</a>]</span>) are conceived as Layer 2
            devices, and as such, they bridge a frame from one medium (e.g.,
            Wi-Fi <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11</a>]</span>) to another (e.g., Ethernet <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.3" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.3</a>]</span>).  This means that the MAC address of a wireless
            device often exists on the wire beyond the wireless
            access device.  Devices connected to this wire also implement IEEE 802.3 technologies
            <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.3" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.3</a>]</span>, and as such, they operate on
            the expectation that each device is associated with a MAC address
            that persists for the duration of continuous exchanges.  For
            example, switches and bridges associate MAC addresses to
            individual ports (so as to know to which port to send a frame
            intended for a particular MAC address).  Similarly, AAA services
            can validate the identity of a device and use the device MAC
            address as the first pointer to the device identity (before
            operating further verification).  Similarly, some networking
            devices offer Layer 2 filtering policies that may rely on the
            connected MAC addresses. IEEE 802.1X-enabled devices <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.1X" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.1X</a>]</span> may also selectively put the
            interface in a blocking state until a connecting device is
            authenticated.  These services then use the MAC address as the first
            pointer to the device identity to allow or block data traffic.
            This list is not exhaustive.  Multiple services are defined for Ethernet networks
            <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.3" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.3</a>]</span>, and multiple services
            defined by the IEEE 802.1 working group are also applicable to Ethernet networks
            <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.3" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.3</a>]</span>. Wireless access points may
also connect using other mediums (e.g., the Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)
<span>[<a href="#DOCSIS" class="cite xref">DOCSIS</a>]</span>) that implement mechanisms under the umbrella of
the general 802 Standard and therefore expect the unique and

            also operate a MAC layer function. For example, routers provide
            IP forwarding services but rely on the device MAC address to
            create the appropriate frame structure.  Other devices and
            services operate at upper layers but also rely upon the IEEE 802
            principles of unique MAC-to-device mapping.  For example, the Address
            Resolution Protocol (ARP) <span>[<a href="#RFC826" class="cite xref">RFC826</a>]</span> and Neighbor Discovery

               present over the wire if the infrastructure connection device (e.g., access point) functions as a Layer 2 
               bridge, observers may be positioned over the wire and may read transmission MAC addresses. Such capability
               supposes that the observer has access to the wired segment of the broadcast domain where the frames
               are exchanged. A broadcast domain is a logical segment of a network in which devices 
               can send, receive, and monitor data frames from all other devices within the same segment.  
               In most networks, such capability requires physical access to an infrastructure wired

<p id="section-4-1">The surface of PII exposures that can drive MAC address randomization depends on (1) the
        environment where the device operates, (2) the presence and nature of other devices in the
        environment, and (3) the type of network the device is communicating through. Consequently, a device
        can use an identifier (such as a MAC address) that can persist over time if trust with the
        environment is established, or it can use an identifier that is temporary if an identifier is required
        for a service in an environment where trust has not been established. Note that trust is not binary.
        It is useful to distinguish what trust a personal device may establish with the different entities

            This is a typical home network with Wi-Fi in the LAN and Internet
            in the WAN.  In this environment, traffic over the Internet does
            not expose the MAC address of the internal device if it is not
            copied to another field before routing happens. The wire segment
            within the broadcast domain is under the control of the user and
            is usually not at risk of hosting an eavesdropper. Full trust is
            typically established at this level among users and with the
            network elements. Note that "Full trust" in this context is
            referring to the MAC address persistency. It does not extend to
            full trust between applications or devices.  The device trusts the
            access point and all Layer 2 domain entities beyond the access
            point, where the Wi-Fi transmissions can be detected, but there is no
            guarantee that an eavesdropper will not observe the
            communications. As such, even in this
            environment, it is common to assume that attackers may still be able to monitor
            unencrypted information such as MAC addresses. If a device decides
            to not fully trust the network, it might apply any necessary
            policy to protect its identity.

<p id="section-6-1">Different network environments provide different levels of network
         services, from simple to complex.  At its simplest level, a network
         can provide a wireless connecting device with basic IP communication
         service (e.g., DHCPv4 <span>[<a href="#RFC2131" class="cite xref">RFC2131</a>]</span> or Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <span>[<a href="#RFC4862" class="cite xref">RFC4862</a>]</span>) and an ability to connect to the Internet (e.g.,
         DNS service or relay and routing in and out through a local gateway).
         The network can also offer more advanced services, such as managed
         instant messaging service, file storage, printing, and/or local web
         service. Larger and more complex networks can also incorporate more
         advanced services, from AAA to Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) applications. To the network,
         its top priority is to provide the best quality of experience to its
         users. Often the network contains policies that help to make a
         forwarding decision based on the network conditions, the device, and
         the user identity associated to the device.  For example, in a
         hospital private network, the network may contain a policy to give
         highest priority to doctors' Voice-Over-IP packets. In another
         example, an enterprise network may contain a policy to allow
         applications from a group of authenticated devices to use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <span>[<a href="#RFC3168" class="cite xref">RFC3168</a>]</span> for congestion and/or Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) <span>[<a href="#RFC8837" class="cite xref">RFC8837</a>]</span> for classification to signal the network for a
         specific network policy. In this configuration, the network is
         required to associate the data packets to an identity to validate the
         legitimacy of the marking.  Before RCM, many network systems used a
         MAC address as a persistent identity to create an association between
         user and device. After implementing RCM, the association is
         broken.<a href="#section-6-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-6.1-1">Wireless access points and controllers use the MAC address to validate the device connection
            context, including protocol capabilities, confirmation that authentication was completed, quality
   of service
            or security profiles, and encryption keying material. Some advanced access points and controllers also include
            upper layer functions whose purpose is covered below. A device changing its MAC address, without
            another recorded device identity, would cause the access point and the controller to lose the
            relation between a connection context and the corresponding device.
            As such, the Layer 2 infrastructure does not know that the device (with its new MAC address)
            is authorized to communicate through the network. The encryption keying material is not identified
            anymore (causing the access point to fail to decrypt the device packets and fail to select the
            right key to send encrypted packets to the device). In short, the entire context needs to be
            rebuilt, and a new session restarted. The time consumed by this procedure breaks any flow that
            needs continuity or short delay between packets on the device (e.g., real-time audio, video,
            AR/VR, etc.). For example, <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11i" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11i</a>]</span>
            recognizes that a device may leave and rejoin the network
            after a short time window.  As such, the standard suggests that the
            infrastructure should keep the context for a device for a while after
            the device was last seen. The device should maintain the same MAC address in such a scenario.<a href="#section-6.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.1-2">Some network equipment such as multi-layer routers and Wi-Fi access points, which serve both 
            Layer 2 and Layer 3 in the same device, rely on ARP <span>[<a href="#RFC826" class="cite xref">RFC826</a>]</span> and NDP <span>[<a href="#RFC4861" class="cite xref">RFC4861</a>]</span>
            to build the MAC-to-IP table for packet forwarding. 
            The size of the MAC address cache in the Layer 2 switch is finite. 
            If new entries are created
            faster than the old entries are flushed by the idle timer, it is possible to cause an unintentional 
            denial-of-service attack. For example, the default timeout of the MAC address cache in Linux is set to 300 seconds.
            Aggressive MAC randomization from many devices in a short
            time interval (e.g., less than 300 seconds) may cause the Layer 2 switch to exhaust its resources, holding in memory
            traffic for a device whose entry can no longer be found. For the RCM device, these 
            effects translate into session discontinuity and disrupt the active sessions. The discontinuity impact
            may vary. Real-time applications such as video conference may experience
            short interruption while non-real-time applications such as video streaming may experience minimal or no impact.
            The device should carefully balance when to change the MAC address after analyzing the nature of the running applications and its
            privacy policy.<a href="#section-6.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.1-3">In wireless contexts, IEEE 802.1X authenticators <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.1X" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.1X</a>]</span> rely on the device and 
            user identity validation provided by a AAA server to change the interface from a blocking state to 
            a forwarding state. The MAC address is used to verify that the device is in the authorized list 
            and to retrieve the associated key used to decrypt the
            device traffic. A change in MAC address causes the port to be closed to the device data traffic
            until the AAA server confirms the validity of the new MAC address. Consequently, MAC address 
            randomization can disrupt the device traffic and strain the AAA server.<a href="#section-6.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-6.1-4">Without a unique identification of the device, DHCPv4 servers <span>[<a href="#RFC2131" class="cite xref">RFC2131</a>]</span> lose track of 
            which IP address is
            validly assigned. Unless the RCM device releases the IP address before changing its MAC address,
            DHCPv4 servers are at risk of scope exhaustion, causing new devices (and RCM devices)
            to fail to obtain a new IP address. Even if the RCM device releases the IP address before
            changing the MAC address, the DHCPv4 server typically holds the released IP address for a certain duration,
            in case the leaving MAC returns. As the DHCPv4 server <span>[<a href="#RFC2131" class="cite xref">RFC2131</a>]</span> cannot know if 
            the release is due to a temporary
             disconnection or a MAC randomization, the risk of scope address exhaustion exists even in cases
            where the IP address is released.<a href="#section-6.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

            this behavior is against standard operation and existing privacy recommendations. Implementations must

            policies can be in place to control the
            traffic of some devices (e.g., parental control or blocklist filters). These policies are often

<p id="section-6.1-9">In managed residential settings (environment type B) and in enterprises (environment types

            MAC address randomization, real-time support is only possible if the user can provide the
            current MAC address. Service improvement support is not possible if the MAC address that

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.1-1">In a typical enterprise Wi-Fi environment, IEEE 802.1X authentication <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.1X" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.1X</a>]</span> coupled with
      WPA2 or WPA3 <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11i" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11i</a>]</span> encryption schemes are commonly used for onboarding a Wi-Fi device. 
      This allows the mutual identification of the client device or the user of the device and an 
      authentication authority. The authentication exchange does not occur in clear text, and the user or device 
      identity can be concealed from unauthorized observers. However, in most cases, the authentication authority is 
      under the control of the same entity as the network access provider. This may lead to exposing the user 
      or device identity to the network owner.<a href="#appendix-A.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.1-2">This scheme is well-adapted to an enterprise environment, where a level of trust is established between the user 
      and the enterprise network operator. In this scheme, MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and 
      reconnections (under the rules of <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11bh" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11bh</a>]</span>). Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated 
      cost of service 
      disruption, an additional load on the enterprise infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. The adoption of this scheme is limited outside of the enterprise 
      environment by the requirement to install an authentication profile on the end device, which would be recognized and accepted 
      by a local authentication authority and its authentication server. Such a server is uncommon in a home environment, and the 
      procedure to install a profile is cumbersome for most untrained users.
      The likelihood that a user or device profile would match a profile recognized by 
      a public Wi-Fi authentication authority is also fairly limited. This may restrict the adoption of this scheme for public 
      Wi-Fi as well. Similar limitations are found in the hospitality environment. The hospitality environment refers to space provided 
      by the hospitality industry, which includes but is not limited to hotels, stadiums, restaurants, concert halls, and hospitals.<a href="#appendix-A.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.2-1"> In order to alleviate some of the limitations listed above, the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) OpenRoaming 
      standard introduces an intermediate trusted relay between local venues (places where some public Wi-Fi is available)
      and sources of identity  
      <span>[<a href="#I-D.tomas-openroaming" class="cite xref">WBA-OPENROAMING</a>]</span>. The federation structure extends the type of authorities that can be 
      used as identity sources (compared to the typical enterprise-based IEEE 802.1X scheme for Wi-Fi <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.1X" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.1X</a>]</span>)
      and facilitates the 
      establishment of trust between local networks and an identity provider. Such a procedure increases the likelihood 
      that one or more identity profiles for the user or the device will be recognized by a local network. At the same time, 
      authentication does not occur to the local network. This may offer the possibility for the user or the device to keep 
      their identity obfuscated from the local network operator, unless that operator specifically expresses the requirement to 
      disclose such identity (in which case the user has the option to accept or decline the connection and associated identity exposure).<a href="#appendix-A.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.2-2">The OpenRoaming scheme seems well-adapted to public Wi-Fi and hospitality environments. It defines a framework to protect 
      the identity from unauthorized entities while permitting mutual authentication between the device or the user 
      and a trusted identity provider. Just like the standard IEEE 802.1X scheme for Wi-Fi <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.1X" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.1X</a>]</span>, 
      authentication allows for the establishment of WPA2 or WPA3 keys <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11i" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11i</a>]</span> that can then 
      be used to encrypt the communication between the device and the access point. The encryption adds extra protection
      to prevent the network traffic from being eavesdropped.<a href="#appendix-A.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.2-3">MAC address randomization can occur through brief disconnections and reconnections 
      (under the rules of <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11bh" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11bh</a>]</span>). Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service disruption,
      an additional load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, and an associated benefit of limiting the exposure of a 
      continuous MAC address to external observers. Limitations of this scheme include the requirement to first install one or more profiles 
      on the client device. This scheme also requires the local network to support RADSEC <span>[<a href="#RFC6614" class="cite xref">RFC6614</a>]</span>
      and the relay function, which may not be common in small hotspot networks and home environments.<a href="#appendix-A.2-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.2-4">It is worth noting that, as part of collaborations between the IETF MADINAS Working Group and WBA around OpenRoaming, some RADIUS privacy 
      enhancements have been proposed in the IETF RADEXT Working Group. For instance, <span>[<a href="#I-D.ietf-radext-deprecating-radius" class="cite xref">RADIUS</a>]</span>
      describes good practices in the use of Chargeable-User-Identity (CUI) between different visited networks, making it better 
      suited for public Wi-Fi and hospitality use cases.<a href="#appendix-A.2-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="appendix-A.3-1"> Most client OS vendors offer RCM schemes that are enabled by default (or easy to enable) on client devices. 
      With these schemes, the device changes its MAC address, when not associated, after having used a given MAC address for a 
      semi-random duration window. These schemes also allow for the device to manifest a different MAC address in different SSIDs.<a href="#appendix-A.3-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="appendix-A.3-2">Such a randomization scheme enables the device to limit the duration of exposure of a single MAC address to observers. 
         In <span>[<a href="#IEEE_802.11bh" class="cite xref">IEEE_802.11bh</a>]</span>, MAC address randomization is not allowed during a given association session, and MAC 
         address randomization can only 
         occur through disconnection and reconnection. Authentication may then need to reoccur, with an associated cost of service disruption and  
         additional load on the venue and identity provider infrastructure, directly proportional to the frequency of the randomization. The scheme 
         is also not intended to protect from the exposure of other identifiers to the venue network (e.g., DHCP option 012 [host name] visible to the 
         network between the AP and the DHCPv4 server).<a href="#appendix-A.3-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
